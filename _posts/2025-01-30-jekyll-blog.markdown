# Hello, world!
Hey there! i've just set up this jekyll page to blog my progress / share my thoughts about ITVitae's bonus track. This page doubles as my first assignment from this track.

# About the setup
The jekyll setup was quite easy, but i had some trouble with the installation. Jekyll was installing, but after that finished, none of the commands would work and i'd have to reinstall it. Opening cmd as an admin fixed this partially, but jekyll is still acting a bit funky. I've tried to narrow the problem down, but couldn't find anything.
