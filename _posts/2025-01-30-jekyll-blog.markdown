# Hello, world!
Welcome to my first blog! I've just set up jekyll hosting via github pages, and i will be using this blog to track my progress through the bonus track i'm doing for school. This means i will be posting my opinion about several different topics / assignments. I think it's important to keep in mind that this is all based on personal opinions.

## Note:
 This blog post is not finished yet, and will only be pushed for testing purposes.
